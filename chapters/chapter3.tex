\chapter{Diagnosis Algorithm} \label{ch:diagnosis}
In this chapter will be outlined the diagnosis algorithm developed by IBM Research and a fellow student at Universit√† degli Studi di Brescia. This algorithm is based on a novel reputation-based approach that makes use of the informations available in the semantic graph to identify cause-effect relationships and use these relationships to isolate relevant diagnosis basing on the timeseries data.
