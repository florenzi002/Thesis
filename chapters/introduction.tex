\label{ch:introduction}
Industrialised countries are facing challanges that are strictly related to energy consumption. Although great efforts in studying novel energy sources are profused by both public and private entities, these solutions need to be sustained by efforts aimed at the reduction of energy wasting. Around 32\% of total energy consumption in industrialized countries is used for electricity, heating, ventilation and air-conditiong (HVAC) in commercial buildings. Studies have shown that early detection of faults in those systems and their operation could lead to energy savings between 15\% to 32\%, improving the overall buildings efficiency. This scenario does not only offer great opportunities related to environmental protection but gives companies a chance for sensible expense reduction. Around 14\% of commercial buildings in the US (as of 2012) deployed Building Management System (BMS), supported by the increasing number of available sensors and improvement in the Internet of Things technologies. These efforts end up facing scalability issues due to the lack of common schema for data coming from a variety of building, vendor and location specific sources. Applications developed for ... //TODO continue
